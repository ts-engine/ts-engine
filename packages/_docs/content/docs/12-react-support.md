# React support

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is supported out the box. If `react` is found in your `package.json` then:

- React's [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) preset is applied automatically. This means your builds and tests will support JSX.
- React and web a11y [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration is automatically applied. This means your linting will catch issues related to web accessibility and React code.
